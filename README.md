In this assignment, you are going to define a class called Student, which will be used to store student information at a university.

First of all, please write down the behavior you expect from a student. What attributes (i.e., member variables of the class Student) and actions (i.e., member functions of the class Student) may a university student have? 
In a text file called predesign.txt, please write all the member variable and function names you think of.
