What happens if we make these two functions private? 

If we make the two functions private then no other external classes could access the functions.
Also you can safely change the parameters without being changed as opposed for public functions
in which they could easily be changed by removing or adding parameters that affects all the methods
you have used in your program. Private functions should be used when other objects or classes don't
need access to the private function.
